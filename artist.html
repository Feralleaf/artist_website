        <h2>The Artist</h2>
        <p>
            Alex is an independent digital artist from Lithuania. He is fluent in Russian, Lithuanian, and English; developed from his fascination with American cartoons since childhood. He percieves them as pleasant and enjoyable to watch, as well as being the source that has fuelled his passion and creativity.

            As a child, cartoons made Alex aware of situations that he was sheltered, which developed his curiousity and attraction towards them. He admires cartoons like 'Batman', that have introduced realism and unfiltered grimness in a way that is simplifled and easier to comprehend.  Essentially, their ability to simplify complex characters and ideas so that they are easily digestible and are suitable for diverse audiences.

            Instinctively, he takes pleasure in seeing his ideas come to life, especially in the characters and comics that he creates. The creation of characters have arisen from various ideas, including inspiration from inanimate objects, such as a brick and a lampshade. Characters from comics such as 'Tank Girl' by Jamie Hewlett and Alan Martin have been influential. He is attracted to the dipiction of humour through high contrast and bold graphics to illustrate strong chracters.

            Amongst his creations are portraits, scenic landscapes and figure drawings, which comprise of his imagination and material from social media, such as Pinterest. Others have included still life drawings and quick sketches on bits of paper and receipts when ideas come to mind. Alex aspires to become a cartoonist and intends to apply at The Animation Workshop in Denmark to expand and develop his skill set.
